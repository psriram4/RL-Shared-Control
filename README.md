# RL_Playground

During my research, I read many papers and learned about many different reinforcement learning methods. I chose to implement a few of them in specific OpenAI Gym environments: LunarLander-v2 Discrete, LunarLander-v2 Continuous and Retro Pong-v0. The branches of this repository will contain my implementations. I followed many tutorials for these implementations, so I have pasted links from where I drew inspiration or obtained inspiration from.
